      <description>WHO AM I?Link to headingHighly motivated and obsessively focused, I guess, is the best way to describe me. I commit myself entirely to every single project I work on because, for me, software development is more than just my job; it is also my hobby and my passion. My main fields of interest are networking, web3 technologies, and cybersecurity.
Iâ€™ve been programming since I was 15, and from that point onward, I knew that technology was my vocation.</description>
