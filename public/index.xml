      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon the joy of running, especially on trails. Being out in nature has always been my thing, and running through the wild feels like the ultimate freedom. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about the exercise; it&amp;rsquo;s about pushing myself, seeing how far I can go, and feeling alive in the process. Trail running is my escape, my challenge, and my way of embracing the beauty of the great outdoors while pushing my own limits.</description>

      <description>Passionate and deeply focused, I thrive in the ever-evolving world of technology. With a degree in Computer and Telematics Engineering from the University of Aveiro, I&amp;rsquo;ve expanded my horizons across various tech domains. I commit myself entirely to every single project I work on because, for me, software development is more than just my job; it is also my hobby and my passion. My main fields of interest are networking, web3 technologies, cybersecurity and microcontrollers.</description>
