      <description>Here we go&amp;hellip;
If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, it&amp;rsquo;s probably because you either follow me closely (which is a bit concerning), stumbled upon it randomly (what were you even searching for?), or I did something so incredible that you think everything I write is pure gold and MUST be read. Well, if that&amp;rsquo;s the case, let me burst your bubble: this post isn&amp;rsquo;t anything special.
Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I&amp;rsquo;m starting this blog or if this will be the first and last post.</description>

      <description>Tech geek since a young age, now knee-deep in a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Cybersecurity at the University of Aveiro. I live and breathe software development, where I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a strong interest in network security, malware and reverse engineering.
I started my research journey tackling Software Defined Networks with a Graduate Research Scholarship and currently working on improving support for legacy non-5G devices in 5G network by improving authentication and authorization mechanisms between them.</description>
