I commit myself entirely to every single project I work on because, for me, software development is more than just my job; it is also my hobby and my passion. My main fields of interest are <strong>networking</strong>, <strong>web3 technologies</strong>, and <strong>cybersecurity</strong>.</p><p>Iâ€™ve been programming since I was 15, and from that point onward, I knew that technology was my vocation. Nowadays, I have the pleasure and opportunity of studying <em>Computer and Telematics Engineering</em> at the <em><strong>University of Aveiro</strong></em>, which has broadened my view of this field and has been an amazing learning journey. In <strong>2022</strong> I&rsquo;ve also started a <em><strong>Undergraduate Student Research Scholarship</strong></em> at <em><strong>Instituto de TelecomunicaÃ§Ãµes</strong></em> center in Aveiro in the field of microcontroller network communication for the <em>FireTech</em> project, which aims to develop a <strong>system of wildfire detection and population warning</strong> via existing fiber optics network and local radio station broadcast, respectively.</p><p>In my spare time, I tend to spend it <strong>developing my own ideas</strong> (of which I seem to never get enough) for innovative systems and application. I&rsquo;m also a volunteer firefighter and as such I tend to <strong>draw inspiration from my personal experiences in the field of rescue and crisis response</strong> for the development of tools that can aid me and others like me to get the job done well!</p><p>Besides software development, I also am involved in politics, about which I like to write in my <a href=https://david2araujo5.medium.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>blog</a>. I believe that <strong>as a person and citizen, I have the responsibility toward the world and those around me to be my best</strong> and help others have the opportunities they need to reach their full potential.</p><p>And thats me! ðŸ˜œ</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>Â©
