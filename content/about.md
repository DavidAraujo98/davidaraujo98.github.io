Tech geek since a young age, now knee-deep in a Master's in Cybersecurity at the University of Aveiro. I live and breathe software development, where I've developed a strong interest in network security, malware and reverse engineering.

I started my research journey tackling Software Defined Networks with a Graduate Research Scholarship and currently working on improving support for legacy non-5G devices in 5G network by improving authentication and authorization mechanisms between them.

When I'm not coding, I'm dreaming new systems and projects, fighting fires or trails running, and thats me: passionate, focused, and always up for a challenge!

# Experience

### Graduate Student Researcher

- *09/2023 - Present*
- *Instituto de Telecomunicações*

Improve non-5G devices authentication and authorization (AA) mechanisms and support for legacy device in 5G networks, as its functions require devices to have 5G credentials.

### Undergraduate Student Researcher

- *11/2022 - 07/2023*
- *Instituto de Telecomunicações*

Inserted in the FireTec project, my position was created with the intent of adding CAP (Common Alert Protocol) communication support to the existing infrastructure. (see [1](#publications))

# Projects

### [Reverse Engineering - PDF Manager Malicious Android Application](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/re-android-reversing)
- *2024*

Analysis of the PDF Reader File Manager application. This app gained notoriety when it was removed from the Play Store. It was developed with the intent of stealing data from Android users, as described in this article [here](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/malware-adware/these-malicious-android-malware-apps-were-downloaded-150000-times-from-the-play-store-delete-them-right-now).

### [Flexible, Risk Aware Authentication System](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/iaa-idp-client)
- *2024*

Design and implementation of an Identity Provider (IdP) using the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and three client services which use it for authentication and authorization.

### [Enhanced DES (E-DES)](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/e-des)
- *2023*

A Implementation of a DES variant known as E-DES, using a 256-bit key, derived from a user-provided password and S-boxes derived from the key, instead of using fixed and known S-boxes.

### [Deterministic RSA key generation (D-RSA)](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/d-rsa)
- *2023*

Deterministic RSA key generation and implementation of a pseudo-random number generator and RSA key generator.
