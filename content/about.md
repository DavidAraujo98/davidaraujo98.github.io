# WHO AM I?

**Highly motivated and obsessively focused**, I guess is the best way to describe me. I commit myself entirely to every single project I work on because, for me, software development is more than just my job, it is also my hobby and my passion. My main fields of interest are **networking**, **web3 technologies**, and **cybersecurity**.

Iâ€™ve been programming since 15 and from that point onward I knew that technology was my vocation, nowadays I have the the pleasure and opportunity of studying *Computer and Telematics Engineering at the University of Aveiro*, which has broaden my view of this field and has been and amazing learning journey.
