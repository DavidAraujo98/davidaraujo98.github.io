**Highly motivated and obsessively focused**, I guess, is the best way to describe me. I commit myself entirely to every single project I work on because, for me, software development is more than just my job; it is also my hobby and my passion. My main fields of interest are **networking**, **web3 technologies**, and **cybersecurity**.

I’ve been programming since I was 15, and from that point onward, I knew that technology was my vocation. Nowadays, I have the pleasure and opportunity of obtaining a Computer and Telematics Engineering bachelors at the **University of Aveiro**, which has broadened my view of this field and has been an amazing learning journey. Currently, I attend the **Master's in Cybersecurity** course at the same university.

Professionally I started as an Undergraduate Student Researcher at **Instituto de Telecomunicações**'s center at Aveiro in the field of microcontroller network communication for the _FireTech_ project, which aims to develop a **system of wildfire detection and population warning** via existing fiber optics network and local radio station broadcast, respectively.  I've since advanced into a **Graduate Research Scholarship** focusing on the DevSecOps of a _Software Defined Network_ controller for large-scale deployment in **_quantum-safe_ environments**.

In my spare time, I tend to spend it **developing my ideas** (of which I seem never to get enough) for innovative systems and applications. I'm also a volunteer firefighter and as such I tend to **draw inspiration from my personal experiences in the field of rescue and crisis response** for the development of tools that can aid me and others like me to get the job done well!

And that's me!
