**Passionate and deeply focused**, I thrive in the ever-evolving world of technology. With a **degree in Computer and Telematics Engineering** from the University of Aveiro, I've expanded my horizons across various tech domains. I commit myself entirely to every single project I work on because, for me, software development is more than just my job; it is also my hobby and my passion. My main fields of interest are **networking**, **web3 technologies**, **cybersecurity** and **microcontrollers**.

In 2022, I contributed to the **FireTech project through an Undergraduate Student Research Scholarship**, focusing on microcontroller network communication for **wildfire detection**. This experience solidified my commitment to leveraging technology for societal good. Since 2023, I advanced into a **Graduate Research Scholarship** focusing on the **DevSecOps of a Software Defined Network controller** for large-scale deployment in _quantum-safe_ environments which will come in hand has I'm currently pursuing a **Master's in Cybersecurity**.

In my spare time, I tend to spend it **developing my ideas** (of which I seem never to get enough) for innovative systems and applications. I'm also a volunteer firefighter and as such I tend to **draw inspiration from my personal experiences in the field of rescue and crisis response** for the development of tools that can aid me and others like me to get the job done well!
