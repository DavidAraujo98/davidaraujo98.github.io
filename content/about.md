# Who am I?

**Highly motivated and obsessively focused**, I guess, is the best way to describe me. I commit myself entirely to every single project I work on because, for me, software development is more than just my job; it is also my hobby and my passion. My main fields of interest are **networking**, **web3 technologies**, and **cybersecurity**.

Iâ€™ve been programming since I was 15, and from that point onward, I knew that technology was my vocation.Nowadays, I have the pleasure and opportunity of studying *Computer and Telematics Engineering at the University of Aveiro*, which has broadened my view of this field and has been an amazing learning journey. In **2022** I've also started a ***Undergraduate Student Research Scholarship* at *Instituto de TelecomunicaÃ§Ãµes*** center in Aveiro in the field of microcontroller network communication for the *FireTech* project, which aims to develop a **system of wildfire detection and population warning** via local radio station broadcast.

In my spare time, I tend to spend it **developing my own ideas** (of which I seem to never get enough) for innovative systems and application. I'm also a volunteer firefighter and as such I tend to **draw inspiration from my personal experiences in the field of rescue and crisis response** for the development of tools that can aid me and others like me to get the job done well!

Besides software development, I also am involved in politics, about which I like to write in my blog. I believe that **as a person and citizen, I have the responsibility toward the world and those around me to be my best** and help others have the opportunities they need to reach their full potential.

And thats me! ðŸ˜œ
