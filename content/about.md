Tech geek since a young age, now knee-deep in a Master's in Cybersecurity at the University of Aveiro. I live and breathe software development, where I've developed a strong interest in network security, malware and reverse engineering.

I started my research journey tackling Software Defined Networks with a Graduate Research Scholarship and currently working on improving support for legacy non-5G devices in 5G network by improving authentication and authorization mechanisms between them.

When I'm not coding, I'm dreaming new systems and projects, fighting fires or trails running, and thats me: passionate, focused, and always up for a challenge!

# Experience

### Graduate Student Researcher

-   _09/2023 - Present_
-   _Instituto de Telecomunicações_

Improve non-5G devices authentication and authorization (AA) mechanisms and support for legacy device in 5G networks, as its functions require devices to have 5G credentials.

### Undergraduate Student Researcher

-   _11/2022 - 07/2023_
-   _Instituto de Telecomunicações_

Inserted in the FireTec project, my position was created with the intent of adding CAP (Common Alert Protocol) communication support to the existing infrastructure. (see [1](#publications))

### [Reverse Engineering - PDF Manager Malicious Android Application](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/re-android-reversing)

Analysis of the PDF Reader File Manager application. This app gained notoriety when it was removed from the Play Store. It was developed with the intent of stealing data from Android users, as described in this article [here](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/malware-adware/these-malicious-android-malware-apps-were-downloaded-150000-times-from-the-play-store-delete-them-right-now).

### [Flexible, Risk Aware Authentication System](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/iaa-idp-client)

Design and implementation of an Identity Provider (IdP) using the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and three client services which use it for authentication and authorization.

### [Enhanced DES (E-DES)](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/e-des)

A Implementation of a DES variant known as E-DES, using a 256-bit key, derived from a user-provided password and S-boxes derived from the key, instead of using fixed and known S-boxes.

### [Deterministic RSA key generation (D-RSA)](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/d-rsa)

Deterministic RSA key generation and implementation of a pseudo-random number generator and RSA key generator.

### [gometric](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/gometric)

A metrics server built in Go that collects system metrics and exposes them via a GraphQL API. It includes support for CPU, memory, disk, network, and process metrics. Deployment can be automated using Terraform and Ansible, or just by running the binary on the target machine.

### [Sentinel](https://github.com/davidjosearaujo/sentinel-analysis)

A CLI tool developed in order to streamline the analysis of traffic captures. Sentinel allows highly specific and precise metric measurements, such as: search for possible exfiltration, search for possible botnet and C&C communication, volume of connection per destination and hourly connection volume.
