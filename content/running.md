Recently, I've stumbled upon the joy of running, especially on trails. Being out in nature has always been my thing, and running through the wild feels like the ultimate freedom. It's not just about the exercise; it's about pushing myself, seeing how far I can go, and feeling alive in the process. Trail running is my escape, my challenge, and my way of embracing the beauty of the great outdoors while pushing my own limits.
