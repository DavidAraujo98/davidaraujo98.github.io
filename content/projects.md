# Personal

These are some of the projects I've worked on my spare time, they are also the ones I had the most fun developing.

### EPHScores

An application for medical emergency first responders in Portugal. It provides an easy way to calculate various scores and evaluations of the patient, soo to ease and accelerate the help and care.

### SensorMesh

SensorMesh allows you to direct output from serial devices and internal services into a distributed peer-to-peer database on IPFS. SensorMesh is built as a layer of abstraction and service compatibility for OrbitDB. It is built in Go and uses the go-orbit-db module developed by the folks at Berty.

### CAP Parser library

CAP is a XML message-formatted based communication focussed one structuring the main aspects of any given emergency in a easy to read/easy to exchange message. This messages can then be used for communication between devices and for long-term storage in XML files. These libraries allow for easy creation and manipulation of CAP messages.

[Python](https://test.pypi.org/project/capparser/)

# University

During my college experience, I also developed some interesting systems, some of my favorite are listed bellow.

### P4Sentry

A network monitoring system that is capable of consulting network devices themselves and retrieving metrics specified by the user. This system needed to possess a dashboard for ease of configuration and metric visualization.

It now continues as open source project, feel free to join !

### E-CHAP Authentication Mechanism

In this project, we were asked to deliver an application that combines the advantageous characteristics of both a password manager as well as providing an E-CHAP authentication protocol that is able to communicate with any service that allows it.

### Vulnerabilities

This project is based on the concept of an online store. It has two versions: one presents several critical security vulnerabilities, and the other is the same system with the vulnerabilities addressed in a correct fashion.

### FestivalPlanner

Music festivals require careful planning before, during, and after they occur, our software provides a simple way of managing stages, musicians, catering, etc. So a database manager in WFA (C#) with connection to an MSSQL database.
