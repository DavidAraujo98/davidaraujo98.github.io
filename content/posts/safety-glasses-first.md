I'm paranoid about safety.

As much as I love getting my hand on a (un)known malicious application or "_scratching that hitch_" of clicking on those sketchy phishing email, I love more knowing that after I get bored doing it, my machine will no be infected or that little voice in my head won't be telling me that I need to, again, erase my disk and re-install my OS.
