Here we go...

If you're reading this, it's probably because you either follow me closely (which is a bit concerning), stumbled upon it randomly (what were you even searching for?), or I did something so incredible that you think everything I write is pure gold and **MUST** be read. Well, if that's the case, let me burst your bubble: this post isn't anything special.

Honestly, I don't know why I'm starting this blog or if this will be the first and last post. Maybe I just want to say I tried blogging and it flopped. This is probably one of my biggest flaws, affecting all aspects of my life. I change my mind too quickly, and what seems like a cool project today feels obsolete tomorrow. I'm always chasing new ideas, maybe out of boredom. Proof of that? I should probably be working on my Master's Thesis right now, but I'll do that later. (I know what you're thinking: "You're just a procrastinator." Well, no! I do things, but I probably try to do too many. Let's just agree I'm not very organized.)

So, what's this blog about? As I hinted, I'm in my final year of a Cybersecurity Master's. While I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do professionally, I'm always afraid of limiting myself too much and missing out on cool stuff. That's why, like many in cybersecurity, **I decided to create a blog as an excuse to pursue cool side projects** and, who knows, maybe **CHANGE THE WORLD**! But probably not.

You should also know that I'm not a cybersecurity genius. At least, I don't feel like one. But who does? This field is constantly and rapidly changing. As a recent university graduate, it feels like I'll never catch up, like I've been thrown into the deep end of a pool without knowing how to swim, expected to perform a synchronized swimming Olympic routine. Well, I won't! I'll probably drown, but I suspect I won't be alone.

My main interests are **reverse-engineering**, **malware analysis**, **bug-hunting**, and **networking**. However, my background in computer science and telematics means I might sometimes just want to develop an app based on a random idea. Like I said, I won't limit myself too much.

I hope you enjoy this blog as long as it lasts and find my projects interesting and fun. I'm open to suggestions and ideas.

See you soon!
